            <table><tr><td style="color: #9D0668;">Alexandria Ocacio Cortez</td><td>AOC, as she is effectionately called by her followers, is a feminist IDOL! She is a congresswoman, since 2019, community organizer, and a fierce woman not to be played with. She has consistently butt heads with many other political figures, most notably, former President Trump. </td></tr><tr><td>Kamala Harris</td><td>Kamala Harris is now the <b>FIRST</b> female Vice President of the United States! During a debate with former VP Mike Pence, she stood her ground on all topics and even insisted that Pence <span style="font-size: 18pt"><b>let her speak</b></span>. As women, we all know how often we can be interreupted. Kamala Harris making this statement sent cheers through the feminist community.</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #9D0668;">Angela Merkel</td><td>While Angela Merkel prefers not to label herself a feminist, she speaks up for many feminist values. Angela Merkel is the Chancellor of Germany, one of the worlds most powerful women! She has found herself calling out many groups for their overt male presence, especially in leadership positions. She also had words about the fact that men in politics do not get judged for their choice in clothing, as women do.</td></tr><tr><td>Bernie Sanders</td><td>We had to make a special spot for the one and only <b>BERNIE SANDERS</b>! Bernie is for the people, ALL people. Most of the policies that Bernie rallies for impact women. This includes reproductive rights, minimum wage policies, childcare, etc. We here at Elect Women! believe that feminism is for everyone. It is a true want for women and men to just have equal rights, as well as equal pay and that is something Bernie Sanders has often called for.</td></tr></table>

        </main><aside><h2>Get out and VOTE!</h2><div id="vote" alt="Letter board that displays the word VOTE"></div><p>Hopefully this election has shown many women and men that getting out and voting does make a difference. A huge difference. For four years, democrats, feminists, and supporters of human decency have had to live with their president being a classless, corrupt, reality TV star. We waited 4 years to rally together and go out and VOTE, and we made a difference. Is Joe Biden the perfect choice for feminism? Maybe not, but we do know he is going to be much easier to work with. Make sure every election year you are...<br><ul><li>Registered to vote</li><li>Research your candidates</li><li>Update your ID if it is expired or you have moved</li><li>And VOTE!</li></ul></aside>
