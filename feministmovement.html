            <h4> Learn all about the feminist movement and how YOU can help!</h4>
            <p>Feminism can mean so many things for so many different people. For some feminism is being independent and paying for meals on dates. For others it means fighting for equal pay at work. There is no one right way to describe feminism. What feminism does <b>not</b> mean though, is that women are better than men.<br><br> Feminism is all about equality. Equal pay, Equal rights, and Equal opportunities. Did you know before Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a lawyer, employers could fire women for becoming pregnant? Did you also know that women used to not be able to get bank accounts without a male cosigner? This was just back in the 1970's! We are only just scratching the surface of true equality. Some people ask, "Don't women have all the same rights as men already? Don't they make enough?" The short answer is, "<b>Hell no!</b>". The fight for equality won't end until women are treated the same as men in the workplace, in politics, and in their own home! Have you ever heard a reporter ask a male politician who is he wearing or how he balances being a dad and a mayor? Most likely not, but these types of questions are asked of women in politics all of the time.<br><br>The easiest way you can help fight the patriarchy is at home. Assert your independence when you need. Don't let anyone make you feel small and insignificant. You are powerful! Fight for other women, don't tear them down. Support the women in your life however you can. Next, be sure to always write your local politicians when you feel there is a way to help bring equality in your town. Let them know if you hear of any instances of gender discrimination around town. Finally, always be open to learning about ways to bring equality to men and women. It's never too late to learn about something new. Good luck <b>WARRIORS</b>!</p>
